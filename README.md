About
=====

This small bash-script is originally intended for use with OpenGPSTracker on Android (https://code.google.com/p/open-gpstracker/ or in Market:https://market.android.com/details?id=nl.sogeti.android.gpstracker). It generates valid GPX-Files out of the GET requests generated by the "Streaming" function of that app and writes them to disk.

Installation
============

It's as simple as that

    chmod 0700 track.cgi #if you have suExec set to the current $USER
    #else: chmod 0701 track.cgi #should work without 
    mv track.cgi /path/to/your/cgi/bin/

Go to the settings of the app, enable streaming to custom URL, enter the URL with all you want to be included (track.cgi silently drops missing arguments if they aren't mandatory)
